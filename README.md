# Programming-Fundamentals-project

In this project i build a game name as Dodge 'Em.
Dodge 'Em is a driving-themed maze game programmed by Carla Meninsky and published in 1980 by Atari, Inc. for the Atari VCS. Similar to Sega's 1979 Head On arcade game, Dodge 'Em is played on a single screen of four concentric roadways. Sears released the game for the "Sears Video Arcade" as Dodger Cars. (Wikipedia)

For playing this game you will need any linux distribution. I used Ubuntu for this project but will work on any distribution.
The only thing you need to have is g++ (c++ linux compiler and some libraries i will discuss later).

Download this project as .ZIP

open terminal and run the following commands

cd Download<br>
unzip Programming-Fundamentals-project-main.zip<br>
cd Programming-Fundamentals-project-main<br>
chmod 777 install-libraries.sh<br>
./install-libraries.sh<br>
(it will take sometime to download the libraries, so wait untill downloading finishes)

make<br>
chmod 777 ./game<br>
./game<br>


Yoooo your game is started.<br>
Now you have 4 options <br>
press <br>
1> to start game<br>
